**Student Performance Analysis**

Project Overview

*Student Performance Analysis* is a machine learning-based project that evaluates and predicts students' academic performance based on various factors. This project aims to provide insights that can help educators and students improve learning strategies and academic outcomes. It was developed as part of an internship submission.

Features

* Data preprocessing (handling categorical and numerical features)
* Machine learning model comparison:

  * Linear Regression
  * Lasso Regression
  * Ridge Regression
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
* Performance evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² score
* Data visualization of model performance and predictions

Technologies Used

* *Programming Language*: Python
* *Libraries*: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Dataset

The dataset student_data.csv includes the following columns:

* math score
* reading score
* writing score
* gender
* race/ethnicity
* parental level of education
* lunch
* test preparation course

A new column *Performance* is created as the average of math, reading, and writing scores.

Model Evaluation

After training the models, the results are compared using:

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R² Score

Visualizations

* Bar charts for MAE, RMSE, and R² scores of all models
* Scatter plot for Actual vs. Predicted values
* Regression plot using Seaborn

Results

The best-performing model (with the highest R² score) is used for final predictions.
